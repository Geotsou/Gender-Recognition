# Gender-Recognition
Gender recognition from images of human faces

This program aims to provide a comparison between different CNN models for gender
recognition from face images. By applying several techniques such as data preprocessing and 
hyperparameter tuning attempts were made to increase the performance of the CNN model. 
In the beggining, the results of the baseline model are presented. 
Then, an improved model is designed so as to improve the accuracy of the classification.
Finally, transfering learning is used with the VGG16 architecture.
